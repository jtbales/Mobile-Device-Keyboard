The algorithm will be trained in an online manner, meaning that additional training passages can be submitted and incorporated into the algorithm at the same time as the algorithm is being used to provide autocomplete suggestions. Ideally, the accuracy of the algorithm will improve over time as more and more training passages are incorporated. Due to the deployment environment for this algorithm, efficiency is critical. The data structure utilized by your algorithm should be optimized for space and time.")
